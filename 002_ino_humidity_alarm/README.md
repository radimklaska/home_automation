Blinks LED when humidity is too high
============

Wanted to try map() function.

LED does basically nothing when humidity is OK.
Blinking gets more "aggressive" with raising humidity.

ToDo:
 * I should REALLY take notes about libraries!
 * Schema (or photo?) is needed too.
 * Numbering projects is probably good idea too.
