Home Automation aka collection of random code.
============

The ambition is to collect data at my home and then automate some tasks based on that.
Be aware that right now it's more of a collection of my test code.

Code is/will be based on various platforms:
 * Arduino (sensors, switches etc.)
 * Raspberry Pi (local server, basic (fallback) logic, relay point)
 * Drupal (data collection, main logic, front end)

Don't expect anything fancy since this is very limited by my free time.
